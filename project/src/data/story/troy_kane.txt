Troy Kane – The Fallen Star

I used to be somebody. Before Luca Stone came along and stole everything I built. My ideas, my style, my audience—he took it all and made it better. Made it his.

That night on the yacht, I wasn't planning anything. I was just drinking, trying to forget how far I'd fallen. But seeing him there, surrounded by all those people who used to follow me... it brought back all the anger.

I confronted him. Told him exactly what I thought of his stolen success. He just laughed it off, like he always did. Like I was nothing. Like I'd never been anything.

But I didn't kill him. I wanted to hurt him, sure. Wanted to expose him for the fraud he was. But murder? That's not my style. I'm too loud, too obvious. If I'd done it, everyone would know.

The real killer is someone smarter than me. Someone who could plan it out, make it look like an accident or frame someone else. Someone who had more to lose than just pride.

I suspect Zane Walker. Zane gave him the pills. He's acting all innocent but I know what I saw.
