Jasmine Hart – The Girlfriend with Regrets

I didn't mean to hurt anyone. Not Zane, not Luca. It started out as a mistake. Then it became a secret. Then it turned into something I couldn't control.

Jasmine Hart is a rising influencer and Luca's friend. Known for her sweet personality and genuine nature, she was often seen with Luca at events. Before the murder, she noticed Luca's growing tension with Serena. During the party, she saw Serena arguing with Luca and acting suspiciously.

Thoughts about the suspects:
- Serena: That psychic girl gives me the creeps. Always muttering to herself. I saw her arguing with Luca earlier. She had that look in her eyes - like she was planning something dark. I don't trust her 'gift' at all.
- Zane: He's always been a bit of a loose cannon. But I don't think he had it in him to kill someone. He's more of a talker than a doer.
- Nora: She's ambitious, always trying to get ahead. But I don't see her having it in her to kill someone.
- Logan: He's quiet, but I trust him. He's always been professional.
- Troy: He's just a party animal. I don't think he had the brains to plan something like this.
- Evelyn: She's always been shrewd, but I don't see her getting her hands dirty. She's more of a puppet master type.

The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced Serena had something to do with this. She was always jealous of Luca's success, and her 'psychic visions' always seemed a bit too convenient. Maybe she saw this as her chance to finally get the attention she craves...

That night, I was looking for Zane. I wanted to tell him everything. I never got the chance. I saw Evelyn talking to Logan—passing him an envelope. I didn't think much of it. PR stuff, maybe. Something about planning content.

But then the footage disappeared. And Luca was gone.

I don't know if Evelyn set this in motion. But I know she saw me. She knew about me and Luca. And she never said a word. Just kept smiling. Like it was all part of the story.

I suspect Evelyn Stone. She always knew everything. Always watching. I don't trust that woman at all.
