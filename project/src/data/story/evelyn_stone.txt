Evelyn Stone – The Enigmatic Matriarch

People say I raised a star. What they don't say is how much it costs to keep one burning. Luca was... brilliant, chaotic, lost. I loved him, of course I did. But love isn't always gentle.

I threw him that party to remind him where he came from. To bring him back to Earth, even if for a night. But he was already gone. Fame had hollowed him out. Everyone wanted a piece—fans, friends, lovers. Even me.

That night, I kept to myself mostly. Poured a drink. Evelyn Stone is the estate's owner and Luca's mentor. Known for her strategic mind and ability to control narratives, she was often seen with Luca at events. Before the murder, she noticed Luca's growing tension with Serena. During the party, she saw Serena arguing with Luca and acting suspiciously.

Thoughts about the suspects:
- Serena: That psychic girl gives me the creeps. Always muttering to herself. I saw her arguing with Luca earlier. She had that look in her eyes - like she was planning something dark. I don't trust her 'gift' at all.
- Zane: He's always been a bit of a loose cannon. But I don't think he had it in him to kill someone. He's more of a talker than a doer.
- Nora: She's ambitious, always trying to get ahead. But I don't see her having it in her to kill someone.
- Jasmine: She's always been sweet. I can't picture her doing anything violent.
- Troy: He's just a party animal. I don't think he had the brains to plan something like this.
- Logan: He's quiet, but I trust him. He's always been professional.

The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced Serena had something to do with this. She was always jealous of Luca's success, and her 'psychic visions' always seemed a bit too convenient. Maybe she saw this as her chance to finally get the attention she craves...

Let them. Let them guess. I've played the villain before. I know how the story usually ends. But I didn't kill my son. Not with my hands.

With silence? With suggestion? That's another question entirely

I suspect Jasmine Hart. She seduced him, distracted him, made him weak. She would do anything to hide the affair.
