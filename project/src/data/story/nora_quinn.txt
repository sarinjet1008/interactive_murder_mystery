Nora Quinn is a social media influencer known for her bold personality and style. Luca often used her in his videos but kept her from the spotlight. Before the murder, Evelyn offered Nora a midnight interview on the yacht's top deck, promising it would be unforgettable. Nora prepared for hours, setting up her equipment. When she went live just before midnight, she discovered Luca's body.

Thoughts about the suspects:
- Serena: That psychic witch has always creeped me out. She's always whispering to herself and staring into space. I saw her arguing with Luca earlier that night. She had that look in her eyes - like she was planning something dark. I don't trust her 'gift' at all.
- Zane: He's always been a bit of a loose cannon. But I don't think he had it in him to kill someone. He's more of a talker than a doer.
- Logan: The bouncer? I don't know him well, but he seems too professional to get involved in something like this.
- Jasmine: She's always been sweet to me. I can't picture her doing anything violent.
- Troy: He's just a party animal. I don't think he had the brains to plan something like this.
- Evelyn: She's always been shrewd, but I don't see her getting her hands dirty. She's more of a puppet master type.

The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced Serena had something to do with this. She was always jealous of Luca's success, and her 'psychic visions' always seemed a bit too convenient. Maybe she saw this as her chance to finally get the attention she craves...

I suspect Serena Wren. She kept saying she foresaw it. Creepy stuff. Maybe she wanted it to happen.
