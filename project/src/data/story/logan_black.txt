Logan Black is the estate's bartender, a former military veteran with 10 years of service. Known for his discretion and ability to read people, he's trusted with the estate's security systems. Two weeks before the murder, Evelyn asked him to delete security footage, claiming it was just Luca ranting about family issues. Logan complied without checking the footage, feeling a mix of loyalty and suspicion.

Thoughts about the suspects:
- Serena: That psychic girl gives me the creeps. Always muttering to herself. I saw her arguing with Luca earlier. She had that look in her eyes - like she was planning something dark. I don't trust her 'gift' at all.
- Zane: He's always been a bit of a loose cannon. But I don't think he had it in him to kill someone. He's more of a talker than a doer.
- Nora: She's ambitious, always trying to get ahead. But I don't see her having it in her to kill someone.
- Jasmine: She's always been sweet. I can't picture her doing anything violent.
- Troy: He's just a party animal. I don't think he had the brains to plan something like this.
- Evelyn: She's always been shrewd, but I don't see her getting her hands dirty. She's more of a puppet master type.

The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced Serena had something to do with this. She was always jealous of Luca's success, and her 'psychic visions' always seemed a bit too convenient. Maybe she saw this as her chance to finally get the attention she craves...

I suspect Zane Walker. He was blackout drunk, unstable. He gave Luca something. I think it spiraled from there.
