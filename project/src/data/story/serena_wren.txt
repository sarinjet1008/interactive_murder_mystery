Serena Wren is a psychic medium and spiritual guide, known for her ability to read people and interpret energies. Before the party, Evelyn warned her about death circling those they love, specifically pointing to Jasmine. During meditation, Serena had a vision of Luca's death, which she recorded. Now she questions whether her vision was genuine or planted by Evelyn.

Her relationship with Luca was deep and spiritual. She genuinely believed she could help guide and protect him through her gifts, but her perceptive nature sometimes created distance between them. She could sense things others couldn't - the tensions, the hidden emotions, the darkness that surrounded their circle.

The visions had been coming for weeks before the party. Clear images of Luca's death that she tried to warn him about, though he often dismissed her concerns as overthinking. She recorded everything in her journal, hoping to find patterns or ways to prevent what she saw coming.

That night, she spent time in meditation, trying to understand the energies swirling around the yacht. The darkness she sensed was overwhelming, and she could feel that someone close to them harbored deadly intentions.

Thoughts about the suspects:
- Evelyn: She taught me how to see people… but she also planted shadows. There's something manipulative about how she guided my visions.
- Zane: Guilt clings to him. He was used—like I was. But his pain feels genuine, not murderous.
- Logan: He's loyal to someone, not sure who. But it scares me. His energy is controlled, hidden.
- Jasmine: Her energy is sharp and heavy. She's drowning in secrets. The darkness around her is thick.
- Nora: So much noise. I can't see through the flash of her presence. Too much performance, not enough truth.
- Troy: His aura burns. Dangerous, volatile. But his anger is too obvious, too raw.

I suspect Jasmine Hart. The visions were clear… she was standing over him, and there was darkness in her aura.
