Zane Walker – The Loyal Friend

Luca and I grew up together. We built his empire together. But somewhere along the way, I became just another employee. Just the guy behind the camera.

That night, I was setting up for what was supposed to be a big announcement. Luca had been acting strange all evening—nervous, distracted. He kept arguing with people, and I could tell something was wrong.

I've been thinking about who could have done this. Troy was angry, sure, but he's too obvious. If he'd killed Luca, we'd all know it. He doesn't have the subtlety for something like this.

Serena's been acting weird with all her psychic stuff, but she genuinely loved Luca in her own twisted way. Nora found the body, but that could just be bad timing. Logan's too professional, too controlled.

But Troy... I saw the way he looked at Luca that night. Pure hatred. And he's been spreading rumors, trying to turn people against Luca for months.

I suspect Troy Kane. He was always angry at Luca, jealous too. I saw the way he looked at him that night.
