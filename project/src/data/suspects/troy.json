  "backstory": "Troy Kane was once a rising star in the influencer scene until Luca allegedly stole his content ideas and audience. Troy blames Luca for his fall from grace and views him as both a thief and a symbol of everything he lost. Their relationship was filled with hostility and unspoken envy.\n\nTroy's resentment ran deep - he believed Luca had deliberately sabotaged his career by copying his content style and poaching his brand partnerships. What made it worse was that Luca was better at it, more charismatic, and had family connections that Troy lacked.\n\nTheir last conversation at the party was loud and aggressive, heard by several guests. Troy had been drinking heavily and confronted Luca about past grievances. Despite his obvious anger and public threats, Troy's rage was too visible and loud to be the calculated murder that took place. His bitterness was genuine but potentially too obvious to be the real motive.\n\nI suspect Zane Walker. Zane gave him the pills. He's acting all innocent but I know what I saw.",
