  "backstory": "Jasmine Hart was caught in a web of deception - officially Zane's girlfriend but secretly involved with Luca. Her affair with Luca added layers of guilt and emotional confusion to her life. Though she admired Luca, she also feared exposure and resented his ability to manipulate those around him, including her.\n\nThe secret relationship was tearing her apart emotionally. She genuinely cared for Zane but was drawn to Luca's charisma and success. The guilt of betraying her boyfriend with his best friend was overwhelming, and she had been planning to confess everything to Zane that night.\n\nJasmine saw how Luca could manipulate people's emotions and desires, and she both fell victim to it and resented him for it. Her affair wasn't just about attraction - it was about being made to feel special by someone famous, even though she knew it was wrong. The night of the murder, she was desperately looking for Zane to finally tell him the truth.\n\nI suspect Evelyn Stone. She always knew everything. Always watching. I don't trust that woman at all.",
