  "backstory": "Nora Quinn and Luca frequently clashed online for followers and brand deals. Their rivalry was public and bitter, though there were rumors Evelyn once tried to get them to collaborate. Nora resented Luca's fame but also depended on their rivalry for engagement and relevance.\n\nThe relationship was complicated - she hated being in his shadow but needed the conflict for her own brand growth. Their online battles generated significant engagement for both of them, making their rivalry both genuine and performative.\n\nEvelyn had offered Nora a midnight interview on the yacht's top deck, promising it would be 'unforgettable.' Nora prepared for hours, setting up her equipment and believing this would be her breakthrough moment. When she went live just before midnight, she discovered Luca's body, giving her the spotlight she'd always wanted but in the worst possible way.\n\nI suspect Serena Wren. She kept saying she foresaw it. Creepy stuff. Maybe she wanted it to happen.",
