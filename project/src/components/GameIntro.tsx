              The body of Luca Stone, a 26-year-old celebrity influencer, was discovered shortly after midnight aboard a luxury yacht anchored in open waters during a high-profile celebration. He was found slumped in a lifeboat on the sun deck, with visible bruising to the head and ligature marks around his neck. Preliminary forensic analysis indicates he was drugged, then bludgeoned with a camera, and finally strangled with a camera strapâ€”suggesting a staged overdose followed by a deliberate, personal killing. Time of death is estimated between 11:55 PM and 12:05 AM. The yacht had 7 other guests aboard, all now suspects.
